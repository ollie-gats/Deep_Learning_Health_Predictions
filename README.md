# Health Prediction Project - Neural Networks, Ensembles, SVM, KNN

## Overview

This project focuses on classification tasks using a patient dataset to predict critical outcomes: The Length of Stay in hospital and mortality forecasting.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Mortality Prediction:** Utilizing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms to forecast patient mortality.
2. **Length of Stay Prediction:** Employing Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron - MLP) and Ensemble methods to predict patient length of stay.


**Project Scope:**
The project's scope includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to achieve accurate and interpretable predictions for these healthcare outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises approximately 25,000 observations related to patient admissions at the hospital. It includes standard health indicators (e.g., respiratory rate, heart rate) along with admission dates and other relevant variables. The target variables, "Length of Stay" and "HOSPITAL EXPIRE FLAG," are available in the training data for model training.
